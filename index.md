Introduction
------------

This course will introduce how to use Unreal Engine (UE4), one of the most popular game engines to create virtual reality applications. Basic concepts of a virtual reality application will be covered, such as head-mounted device (HMD), controllers, etc. These concepts will be explained concretely using examples from Unreal Engine. Students will learn the workflow of creating a virtual reality application, including how to use 3D assets and basic scripting. There will be two Oculus Rift for demo, experience and development. Knowledge of computer graphics and C++ is encouraged but not required. UE4 is capable to create many kinds of VR applications, varying from famous VR game [RoboRecall](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1081190428622821/) to [architectural visualization applications](https://ue4arch.com/)

Assignment
----------

Assignments are optional but can be chosen from
- An essay about a VR application you want to create
- A simple VR project demonstrating what you learnt from this course, or a team project creating a small VR app

Hardware
--------

Students need to have a windows or mac machine to finish the progammming assignments, Linux is also ok but less recommended. Check this page for recommended hardware: https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Recommended_Hardware#Desktop
